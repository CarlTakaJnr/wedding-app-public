## About This Project

This project is an example version of a wedding website that I originally created for my own wedding. In this version, I have simplified the code and removed any personally identifiable information to ensure privacy. The goal was to keep the code clean and easy to understand, so others can freely use and customize it for their own needs. Feel free to explore the code, make changes, and use it as a template for your own wedding website or any other event.

I will unlikely be doing much to maintain this repo as I work on other projects, there's a lot of places i'd like to improve, such as adding tests, some small ui improvements, adding some better linting checks and various other things.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
